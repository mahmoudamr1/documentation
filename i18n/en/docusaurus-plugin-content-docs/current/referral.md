## Overview

The **Affiliate Marketing** page allows users to earn a **20%** commission on any amounts deposited by users who were invited via the platform. Commissions can be withdrawn as cash (not as store credits).

## Key Elements of the Page

1. **Page Title**  
   At the top of the page, the title clearly outlines the main concept:  
   > "Earn with us through Affiliate Marketing"  
   This indicates the ability to earn a commission for every new user who deposits through your referral link.

2. **Commission Percentage**  
   - The commission rate is **20%**.  
   - This percentage applies to all amounts deposited by users who registered using your referral link.  
   - The commission is lifetime, as long as these users continue to deposit through their accounts.

3. **Current Commission Information**  
   - A dedicated section displays your current commission value in dollars (or the equivalent in the system's set currency).  
   - This value automatically changes as deposits from referred users increase.  
   - **Note**: The image showed an example value of (0 $), but this will change based on the actual performance of your account.

4. **Your Referral Link**  
   - A unique referral link is provided, containing a special Referral Code.  
   - Sharing this link with new users ensures that the platform tracks their deposits, and the commission is credited to your account.  
   - The link can be shared through social media or sent to interested individuals.

5. **Conditions to Earn Commission**  
   - The commission is calculated at a rate of 20% of the amount deposited by the referred user.  
   - The commission is added directly to your account once the deposit is made.  
   - The commission can be withdrawn as cash after contacting the platform's support team.

6. **How to Withdraw Commissions**  
   - It is clarified that you can request a withdrawal via one of the available methods, such as:
     - Bank transfer.  
     - Vodafone Cash transfer (if available in your country).  
   - For withdrawal coordination, you will need to contact the support team through the provided communication channels on the platform.

## Practical Example

- **Share the Link:** Copy your referral link from the "`Your Link`" section.  
- **Invite Friends:** Send the link to your friends or followers so they can register and deposit via the platform.  
- **Earn Your Commission:** When a referred user deposits funds, **20%** of their deposit is added to your commission balance.  
- **Track Your Progress:** You can track the increase in your commission balance in the "Your Commission" section of the page.  
- **Withdraw:** Once you reach the required minimum withdrawal limit (which the platform typically sets), you can request to withdraw your commission.

## Tips for Maximum Benefit

- **Share the Link Regularly:** Make sure to share your referral link consistently on social media pages or groups that are interested in the platform's niche.
- **Explain Platform Benefits:** Clarifying the value that users will get by registering and depositing via your link helps convince them to join.
- **Track Results Regularly:** Ensure that you check the Affiliate Marketing page regularly to monitor your numbers and see the effect of your user invitations.
- **Contact Support:** If you have any questions about the commission calculation process or withdrawal methods, reach out to the support team to avoid mistakes or delays.
