## Explanation of the Missed Orders Page

### 1. **What are Missed Orders?**

- **Missed Orders** are orders created by customers but not sent to the store due to the customer not completing the order fully.
- These orders appear when the customer stops completing the purchase process after adding products to the cart.

### 2. **Displaying Data**

- On this page, you can view the details of missed orders such as:
  - **Customer Name**: The name of the customer who started the purchase process.
  - **Phone Number**: The phone number registered by the customer.
  - **Date and Time**: The date and time when the missed order was created.

### 3. **Handling Missed Orders**

- You can choose to follow up with the missed orders or delete them if you no longer need them.
- You can also track the customer's status if there are additional details related to the order that are not yet completed.

### 4. **Filtering and Searching**

- If there are many missed orders, you can filter the orders based on the date or the customer's name to search for a specific order.

### 5. **Additional Notes**

- Missed orders are opportunities to understand weak points in the purchase process or to follow up with customers who did not complete their order.
- Make sure to follow up on these orders to attempt completing the sale.
