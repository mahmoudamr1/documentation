# Checkout Form

You can access the page for field settings through the following link: [Checkout Form](https://app.easy-orders.net/#/checkout-fields)

### 1. **Adding New Fields:**

Through this page, you can add new fields to the checkout form based on your needs. The fields you can add include:

- **Notes**: A field for the customer to enter notes, where you can define whether this field is required or optional.
- **Detailed Address**: A field for address details such as street, city, etc.
- **Alternative Phone Number**: A field to add an alternative phone number for contact.
- **Email Address**: A field to request the customer's email address.

### 2. **Customizing Fields:**

When adding a field, you can customize its details as follows:

- **Field Name**: This is the name that will appear next to the field in the form (e.g., "Notes" or "Alternative Phone Number").
- **Helper Text**: You can add text that guides the customer on how to fill out the field correctly, such as "Please enter your email address correctly."
- **Order**: You can specify the order of the field in the form (e.g., Order 1, 2, 3) so it appears in the correct position relative to other fields.

### 3. **Editing Existing Fields:**

You can edit any field that was added previously in the following ways:

- **Change Helper Text**: If you want to change the text that appears next to the field (e.g., modify the instructions for the field).
- **Change the Order**: You can modify the order of fields in the form using numbers (e.g., Order 5 or 6).
- **Enable or Disable the Field**: You can make the field optional or mandatory by enabling or disabling the "Is this field required?" option.

### 4. **Deleting Unnecessary Fields:**

If you don't need a particular field in the form, you can simply delete it using the delete button in the edit interface.

### 5. **Setting Required Fields:**

- **Is the field mandatory?**: You can specify whether the customer must fill out this field or not. You can enable or disable this option so that the customer cannot proceed with the checkout without filling in the mandatory fields.

### 6. **Saving Changes:**

After modifying or adding any field or making changes, don't forget to save your changes by clicking the "Save" button. These changes will be applied immediately to your checkout form on your website.
