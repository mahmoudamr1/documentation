## Explanation of the Categories Feature

- **Usage**: You can add, edit, or delete categories to suit your store's needs. You can also define the order of category display using priority.

### 2. **Editing a Category**

- **Main Category Image**: You can add a featured image for the category, which will appear next to the category name in the store.
- **Category Name**: This is the name that will be displayed to customers when the category is shown in the store. The category name should be clear and direct.
- **Link**: This is the URL that defines the category's address. This link is crucial for SEO and should contain appropriate keywords.
- **Show in Header?**: You can choose whether you want the category to appear in the category list in the header (the top bar of the store).
- **Display Priority**: Here, you can define the display priorities of categories. For example, if the "Sportswear" category has higher priority than another, it will appear first.
- **Hidden**: You can hide a category if you do not want it to appear directly to customers, such as for special offers or limited products.
- **Choose a Parent Category for This Category**: If you want to organize categories in a tree structure, you can make this category a subcategory of a main category.
- **Static Content Above the Products in the Category**: If you want to display certain content like text or images above the products in the category, you can enable this feature.
- **Enable HTML Editor**: Enabling the HTML editor allows you to add custom formatting using HTML code to display unique content within the category.

### 3. **Displaying Categories**

- On the Categories screen, you can see all the created categories with options to edit them or view their contents.
- You can also decide if the categories should appear in the header and change their order based on priority.
