## Explanation of the Add Product Page

Through this page, users can easily add a new product to their store. After accessing the page, they can fill in the product details and make several customizations. We will explain these steps in detail:

### 1. **Basic Product Information**

- **Product Name**: The user must enter the name of the product as it will appear in their store.
- **Product Link (SEO)**: This is one of the most important pieces of data for Search Engine Optimization (SEO). It is recommended that the link be the product name or its description (very important for improving the product's ranking in search engines).
- **SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)**: This field is optional. If the product does not require a specific SKU code, it can be left blank.
- **Product Description**: Detailed information about the product is added here. This description will appear to customers in the store to help them make a decision.
- **Product Customizations**: If the product has customizations like color, size, or any other options, these variations can be added.

### 2. **Product Images**

Users can upload the main image of the product as well as additional images. These images will be shown to customers to give them a better understanding of the product.

### 3. **Discounts and Prices**

- **Product Price**: The user can specify the actual price of the product. If there is a discount, the discounted price can be set.
- **Set Special Price for Each Variation**: If the product has variations (such as different colors or sizes), a special price can be set for each variation.
- **Calculate Cost**: The user can calculate the total cost of the product based on variations like size or color.

### 4. **Variation Settings**

- **Variations**: Variations include elements like color (Black, Red, Blue), size (S, M, L, XL, XXL), etc. More than one variation can be added for a single product.
- **Variants**: Variants are combinations of variations, like (Black color with size L). Variants are automatically created based on the variations. For example, if the product has 3 colors and 4 sizes, 12 variants will be created (3 Ã— 4 = 12 variants).

### 5. **Additional Customizations**

- **Display Product on Landing Page**: This feature can be activated to display the product on a dedicated landing page, making it stand out to customers.
- **Add Product to Categories**: You can specify the categories the product belongs to, such as (Beauty Tools, Clothing, etc.). This helps organize products within the store and makes it easier for customers to search.

### 6. **Product with Multiple Variants**

If the product has many variations (like colors and sizes), the variations can be created from the "Multiple Product Features" page. These variations are entered and a special price is set for each one, such as setting a different price for the product based on color or size.

### 7. **Recreate Variants When Modifying**

If you change, add, or remove variations like color, size, or any other features, the variants will be automatically recreated. It is important to ensure that all data is updated after modification, such as prices and available quantities for each variant.

### 8. **Controlling Variants**

- **Variations**: Such as color, size, and weight. Each variation has different elements like black, red, yellow, etc.
- **Variants**: These are combinations of variations, for example, there can be a variant for black color with size L.

### After Adding All Data and Customizations

Once the user has entered all the product data, such as the name, price, variations, and images, they can save the product in the store.
