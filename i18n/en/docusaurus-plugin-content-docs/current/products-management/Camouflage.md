## Explanation of the Camouflage Feature

### 1. **What is the Camouflage Feature?**

- **Purpose**: This feature uses artificial intelligence to analyze data accurately to identify the type of visitor browsing the store.
- **Description**: The technology checks whether the visitor is a bot (like marketing bots) or coming from platforms like Facebook, TikTok, or Snapchat. If it's confirmed that the visitor belongs to one of these types, a completely different product will be displayed than the one initially shown on the website.
- **Benefit**: This feature is essential for products that may be banned on some platforms, like cosmetics or weight-loss products, as it helps avoid bans on social media platforms.

### 2. **Activating the Camouflage Feature**

- **Purpose**: Activating this feature requires first enabling the camouflage option.
- **Description**: To use this feature, you must activate the "Add Camouflage" option. This ensures that the product shown to bot visitors or visitors from social media platforms like Facebook and TikTok will be different from the product shown to other visitors.
- **Control**:
  - This feature can be activated by pressing the activation button on the appropriate page.

### 3. **Displaying Add-ons**

- **Description**: Once camouflage is activated, you will be able to customize how each type of visitor identified by this feature is handled, displaying a different product in specific cases based on the data being analyzed.
