## Explanation of Stock Settings Features

### 1. **Stock Quantity**

- **Purpose**: Defines the available quantity of the product in stock.
- **Description**: When the product quantity reaches 0, it is automatically removed from stock, meaning customers can no longer purchase the product until more units are added.
- **Control**:
  - You can set and update the stock quantity as needed. If the stock reaches zero, customers will not be able to purchase the product.

### 2. **If the Product Has Multiple Variants (such as Colors and Sizes)**

- **Purpose**: If the product has multiple variants (such as color, size), you specify the number of available pieces for each variant.
- **Description**: You must specify the number of pieces available for each variant option (e.g., Black color and size M). This data is used to track the stock accurately.
- **Control**:
  - A quantity must be entered for each option, such as the available pieces for each color or size of the product.

### 3. **Stock Tracking**

- **Purpose**: This feature is activated to track stock and automatically decrease it with each purchase.
- **Description**: When a customer makes a purchase, the stock decreases by one until it reaches zero.
- **Control**:
  - The stock tracking feature can be activated or deactivated as needed. When activated, the stock decreases automatically with each purchase.

### 4. **Disable Product When Out of Stock**

- **Purpose**: This feature prevents users from purchasing the product when the stock reaches zero.
- **Description**: When the product is disabled when out of stock, no one will be able to add the product to the cart or purchase it once the stock reaches zero.
- **Control**:
  - When this feature is activated, the product will be automatically disabled when the stock reaches zero.

### Notes

- You must have sufficient stock for all variants of the product (such as color and size).
- Stock tracking ensures that you do not sell a product that is out of stock.
- Disabling the product when out of stock helps prevent selling an unavailable product, enhancing the customer experience and improving stock management.
