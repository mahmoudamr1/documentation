## Explanation of the Custom Pixel Feature

### 1. **What is the Custom Pixel Feature?**

- **Purpose**: This feature allows you to add a custom pixel for each product in your store. A custom pixel is a tracking tool used to collect and analyze data related to user interactions with a product in the store, whether those interactions are from visiting the product or clicking on the related advertisement.
- **Usage**: You can customize the pixel for each product individually. The custom pixel is used to track interactions with a specific product accurately, helping to optimize ads targeted to that particular product.
- **Features**:
  - **Support for Multiple Platforms**: You can link the pixel with platforms like **Facebook**, **TikTok**, or **Snapchat** to track and analyze your ad campaigns more precisely.
  - **Customizing the Pixel**: You can customize the pixel at the product level in your store, allowing you to track interactions with each product separately.

### 2. **Adding the Pixel**

- **How to Use**: In the designated field on the product page, you can enter the type of pixel you wish to link with the product (such as Facebook, TikTok, or Snapchat). After selecting the pixel type, enter the **Pixel ID** (not the full code) in the provided field.
- **Activation**: After entering the **Pixel ID**, click the **Add** button to complete the linking process.

### 3. **Saving Changes**

- **Execution**: After entering the product's pixel, ensure to save the changes by clicking the **Save** button.
- **Confirmation**: Make sure the added pixel is working correctly and connected to the specific product. Verify that the pixel will track interactions related only to that product.

### Notes

- The pixel is a powerful tool that helps improve the effectiveness of ad campaigns by directly tracking interactions with the product.
- Ensure that the **Pixel ID** is entered correctly, as it only requires the ID and not the full code.
- **Customizing the Pixel for Each Product**: This feature allows you to customize a pixel for each product individually, linking a different pixel to each product based on your requirements, providing precise tracking for each product separately.
